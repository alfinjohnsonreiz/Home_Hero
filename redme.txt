🎯 Goal
Create a home service marketplace with these features:

🧍User can be a Homeowner (who posts service requests) or a Provider (who sends quotes).

🔧 Service requests like Plumbing, Electrical, etc. are posted by homeowners.

📝 Providers send quotes for those requests.

✅ Homeowner accepts one quote, which becomes a Job.

💰 Job is tracked and marked complete, then payment is made.

⭐ Rating is given after job.



Your flow:
Homeowner logs in

Can create service requests.

Can see only their own service requests.

Can see quotes only related to their own service requests.

Provider logs in

Can see all service requests from all homeowners (to pick jobs to quote on).

Can add quotes to any service request.

Can see only their own quotes (quotes they created).
