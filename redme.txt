🎯 Goal
Create a home service marketplace with these features:

🧍User can be a Homeowner (who posts service requests) or a Provider (who sends quotes).

🔧 Service requests like Plumbing, Electrical, etc. are posted by homeowners.

📝 Providers send quotes for those requests.

✅ Homeowner accepts one quote, which becomes a Job.

💰 Job is tracked and marked complete, then payment is made.

⭐ Rating is given after job.
